## How It's Made:

**Tech used**: HTML

This is purely made of HTML in 3 different pages 1 page is for the main page which is the index.html where all recipes will be collapsed into. 3 of the other pages are the vegetables to be suggested to viewers. The creation of these pages mostly comprise of headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and links which are the fundamentals of website creation.

## Optimizations

CSS styling could be added in order to make the page more beautiful. Javascript could also be added to include functionality that you like.

## Lessons Learned:

I have learned html elements such as unordered lists, paragraphs, images, headings, etc. I've also learned about a good markdown writing to make it presentable to future contributors, which is good for anyone who's interested to collaborate. Lastly, I also learned how to use git specially about atomic commits, when to commit, what to commit, conventions of committing, etc.
